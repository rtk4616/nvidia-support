_Description: Run 'nvidia-installer --uninstall'?
 The 'nvidia-installer' program was found on your system.  This is
 probably left over from an earlier installation of the non-free NVIDIA
 graphics driver, installed using the NVIDIA *.run file directly.  This
 installation is incompatible with the Debian packages.  To install the
 Debian packages safely, it is therefore neccessary to undo the changes
 performed by 'nvidia-installer'.

_Description: Delete 'nvidia-installer' files?
 Some files from the 'nvidia-installer' still remain on your system.
 These probably come from an earlier installation of the non-free NVIDIA
 graphics driver using the *.run file directly.  Running the
 uninstallation procedure may have failed and left these behind.  These
 files conflict with the packages providing the non-free NVIDIA graphics
 driver and must be removed before the package installation can continue.

_Description: Remove conflicting library files?
 The following libraries were found on your system and conflict with
 the current installation of the NVIDIA graphics drivers:
 .
 ${conflict-libs}
 .
 These libraries are most likely remnants of an old installation using the
 nvidia-installer and do not belong to any package managed by dpkg.  It
 should be safe to delete them.

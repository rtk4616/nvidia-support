Description: NVIDIA binary graphics driver support files
 This package contains support files needed for all Debian packages of
 NVIDIA graphics drivers and related software.  It takes care that no old
 installation of the drivers that was done with the nvidia-installer
 remains on the system as this will conflict with the packages drivers.
 Furthermore using the nvidia-installer to install a new version of the
 drivers is prevented as long as this package is installed.

Description: NVIDIA binary kernel module support files
 This package contains support files used for any version of the NVIDIA

 work properly.
